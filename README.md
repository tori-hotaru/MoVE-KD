## Overview
![overview](./images/pipeline.png)

Visual encoders are fundamental components in vision-language models (VLMs), each showcasing unique strengths derived from various pre-trained visual foundation models. To leverage the various capabilities of these encoders, recent studies incorporate multiple encoders within a single VLM, leading to a considerable increase in computational cost. In this paper, we present Mixture-of-Visual-Encoder Knowledge Distillation (MoVE-KD), a novel framework that distills the unique proficiencies of multiple vision encoders into a single, efficient encoder model. Specifically, to mitigate conflicts and retain the unique characteristics of each teacher encoder, we employ low-rank adaptation (LoRA) and mixture-of-experts (MoEs) to selectively activate specialized knowledge based on input features, enhancing both adaptability and efficiency. To regularize the KD process and enhance performance, we propose an attention-based distillation strategy that adaptively weighs the different visual encoders and emphasizes valuable visual tokens, reducing the burden of replicating comprehensive but distinct features from multiple teachers.

## Train
Our training procedure is consistent with LLaVA, consisting of two stages: pre-training and fine-tuning. In the pre-training stage, we tune the parameter weights of the student encoder’s MoLE, encoder adapters, and projector, while freezing all other parameter weights. In the fine-tuning stage, all parameter weights are updated except those of the teacher encoders.

### Pre-training 
Training script with DeepSpeed ZeRO-2: [`pretrain-v1.0.sh`](./scripts/move-kd/pretrain-v1.0.sh) and  [`pretrain-v1.1.sh`](./scripts/move-kd/pretrain-v1.1.sh).


### Fine-tuning

Training script with DeepSpeed ZeRO-2: [`finetune-v1.0.sh`](./scripts/move-kd/finetune-v1.0.sh) and  [`finetune-v1.1.sh`](./scripts/move-kd/finetune-v1.1.sh).
